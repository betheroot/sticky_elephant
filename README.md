Sticky Elephant is a [medium-interaction](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9d46/8fa983b844c76a07b1e3ea63d6f7a9cae294.pdf)
PostgreSQL honeypot.

## Usage

Either install the gem and
```
% sticky_elephant
```

or clone the repo and

```
% ./bin/sticky_elephant
```

## Configuration
`sticky_elephant.conf` is a YAML file that defines Sticky Elephant's behavior.
You can tell Sticky Elephant what configuration file to use with `-c`.  The
configuration file looks like this:

```
:log_path: "./sticky_elephant.log"
:port: 5432
:host: 0.0.0.0
:debug: true
:abort_on_exception: false
:use_hpf: true
:hpf_host: 127.0.0.1
:hpf_port: 10000
:hpf_ident: 24b6875e-03f1-4c2a-b5b0-11af1f49e2bb
:hpf_secret: woofwoofcharlesisagooddog
```
`host` and `port` define the host address and port to which Sticky Elephant
should bind.  `log_path` is the log to which Sticky Elephant will write.  Do
note that HPFeeds logs go to `stdout` and are separate from Sticky Elephant
application logs.  `debug` turns on debug-level logging; `abort_on_exception`
kills threads when they encounter an exception.  The `hpf`-prefixed options are
for configuring the HPFeeds server to which Sticky Elephant should report
queries and connections.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
